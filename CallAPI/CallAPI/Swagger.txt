So, Swagger helps us in API Documentation.
So first go to nuget and run the command : install-package swashbuckle -version 5.2.1 this will install the nuget package: swagger and now in app_start
you will find some Swagger.config file which you can change.

For Seeing the comments that we put in api's do below:

 c.IncludeXmlComments(GetXmlCommentsPath()); // uncomment it

And add below:
private static string GetXmlCommentsPath()
{
    return System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory + @"bin\Demo.xml";
}

and now if you add comments in your API it will show properly if you visit http://localhost:58887/swagger/ui/index  and it will tell all API DEtails there.
